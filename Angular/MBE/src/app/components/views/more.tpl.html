  <div class="col-md-8">

      <p>MBE is moving toward a standardization needed for a complex-wide adoption. As a major step in this direction, the Department of Defense (DoD) released the <a href="http://model-based-enterprise.org/Docs/MIL-STD-31000A released on ASSIST 3 13 2013.pdf">MIL-STD-31000A standard</a>, which defines a technical data package (TDP) and outlines modifications to support an MBE lifecycle transformation, providing guidance on the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2D and 3D TDP comparisons</li>
        <li>Alignment between the TDP and the product lifecycle to enable acquisition of the right data at the right point in the lifecycle</li>
        <li>3D TDP definition based on modern data to provide a product definition foundation that can be reused throughout the lifecycle</li>
        <li>Complete up-to-date TDP definition that can be used to competitively bid a product</li>
        <li>Method for structuring and verifying the quality of a 3D TDP</li>
      </ul>

    <p>DoD is also working to transition this standard to NIST.</p>
