  <h1 class="col-sm-12">MBE Advantages</h1>

  <div class="col-md-8">
    <p>In traditional product development, drawings were the definitive definition of the product—drawings that were interpreted and reinterpreted by the different team involved in the development process.</p>
    <p>As computer-assisted design (CAD) proliferated, 2D models and data attached to the models joined drawings as the basis for product definition. The reliance on these multiple, largely uncontrolled, and often separate data sources presented the risk that teams along the development path would be focusing their efforts on out-of-date or misinterpreted data.</p>
    <p>MBE was conceived to remedy these drawback by supporting use of a complete, accurate, under control, and managed dataset as the basis for product definition. As teams accept this dataset as the trusted model—the definitive product definition—the entire product development process should become faster, less complex, more efficient, and less prone to error generated by interpretation.</p>
