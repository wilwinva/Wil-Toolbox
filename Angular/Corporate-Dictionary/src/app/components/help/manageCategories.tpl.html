<p>By design, all corporate terms must be associated with at least one Category. CADM supports multiple Category associations.</p>
<h2>Adding a new Category:</h2>
<p>Select the "Add Category" tab. CADM will prompt for a Category. Type in the new Category name, and click the "Save" Button.</p>
<h2>Updating an existing Category:</h2>
<p>Select the "Edit Category" tab. Select that Category you wish to update from the dropdown. CADM will prompt for a new category name. Type in the new Category name, and click the "Save" Button.</p>
<h2>Deleting Categories:</h2>
<p>Delete is available for those Categories that are NOT currently associated with any term. If the Delete button is grey, this is an indication that SOME
    term is associated with that Category. CADM will prompt for confirmation during a delete operation.
