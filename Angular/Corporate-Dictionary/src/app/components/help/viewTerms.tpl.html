<p>
    The CADM – Corporate Acronym Dictionary Management - application provides a platform
    to maintain a database of Corporate Dictionary and Acronym terms used throughout the policy areas
    and all of Sandia Corporation. The CADM database maintains the acronyms and terms referenced by
    web pages published in ILMS and other corporate web pages.

    CADM was designed to replace a legacy corporate term database (formerly known as
    Business Rules Dictionary), the SPARQL acronym database, and incorporates other Sandia glossaries (ES&H, Finance,
    etc.) for maintenance on a common platform.

<h2>Find Term:</h2>
<p>
    The Find Term screen allows the user to browse, search, filter, select, and view active
    or inactive dictionary terms from the database. Each dictionary term is assigned a unique Term ID number.
    Form fields at the top of the Find Term screen allow the user to filter terms displayed in
    the grid by: Term ID number, a substring Phrase contained within a term, by Policy
    Area, by Policy and Sub-Policy Area, by Sub-Glossary or by Term Owner. Terms can
    also be filtered by "Source." Source refers to the origin of the term either "Business
    Rules" or "ES&H." All new terms have a source of "CADM". These filter fields are logically "ANDed" together. So, for
    instance, one might search for
    terms containing the phrase "accident." Click the "Search" button at the right to apply the filter.
    Double click on a term highlighted in the grid or highlight a term in the grid and click the
    "Edit" button to edit the term record. </p>

<h2>Citing the Corporate Dictionary from other web pages</h2>
<p>
    A set of three (3) javascript functions are available to facilitate embedding the definition
    of Corporate Dictionary terms in other web documents published throughout Sandia
    Corporation.
    getDictionaryTermById(this,id) where "id" is an integer dictionary term id. This
    allows a webpage author to cite exactly one term. (This is the preferred method.)
    Usage:
    <a href="" onclick="return getDictionaryTermById(this,7);" title="Lookup
definition">Acceptable Offer</a>
    getDictionaryTermByName(this,’term name’) where the string ‘term name’ is a term
    stored in the Corporate Dictionary
    Usage:
    <a href="" onclick="return getDictionaryTermByName(this,'acceptable offer');"
       title="Lookup definition">acceptable offer</a>
    getDictionaryTermByAnchor(this,’term_anchor’) where the string ‘term_anchor’ is
    the anchor of a term stored in the Corporate Dictionary
    Usage:
    <a href="" onclick="return getDictionaryTermByAnchor(this,'acceptable_offer');"
       title="Lookup definition">acceptable offer</a>

    These Corporate Dictionary javascript functions can be made available for use in any
    web page by including the javascript source from the following location in <head>
        section of the web page:
        <script src="https://my.sandia.gov/local/common/js/corp_dictionary.js"
                type="text/javascript"></script>
        CADM computes a URL that can be embedded in ILMS documents and displays
        this URL on the Term Edit screen in a read-only text control.
        remoteTermDef.cfm – the legacy way for others to cite the Corporate Dictionary
        https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CADM/remoteTermDef.cfm?TermID=1234
        https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CADM/remoteTermDef.cfm?searchTerm=accident
        https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CADM/remoteTermDef.cfm?searchAnchor=absorbed_dose_(D)
        remoteTermDef looks up terms in the CADM database by:
        TermID, Term name, or Term Anchor.
        The typical and historical use of remoteTermDef has been to annotate pages in ILMS.
        While remoteTermDef.cfm is maintained and supported, the preferred way to cite
        the Corporate Dictionary is via the Javascript functions described in the previous
        section!</p>
