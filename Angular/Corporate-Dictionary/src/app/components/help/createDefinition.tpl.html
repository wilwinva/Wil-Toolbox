<h2>Create Term:</h2>
<p>
    erm records have these required fields: Term, Definition and an association
    with a Category.
</p>
<p>
    Term name – the term to be defined.
</p>
<p>
    Selecting "Inactive" from the "Term is:" dropdown – allows for the inactivation of the term currently being displayed.
    CADM will prompt for "Term Superseded by TermID: ____." Terms are never deleted from the database to avoid broken
    links.
</p>
<p>
    Anchor – a string suitable to be an HTML anchor identifier. Efforts should be made to
    make anchors distinct among all terms in the database. For new terms, an anchor is
    generated based on the text of the Term name (but no uniqueness checking is
    performed). Historically, anchors have been embedded in the text of definitions to
    relate to other terms, such as: "Also see:" and "Related To:"
</p>
<p>
    Popup URL – a URL suitable for embedding in another document. See the section on
    remoteTermDef.cfm for more details.
</p>
<p>Definition – formatted text containing the definition of the current term. Definition is
    stored as HTML and may contain tables, lists, and other font formatting. Where
    applicable, the definition can contain a horizontal list of synonyms.
</p>
<p>
    "Next" button – navigate to the subsequent wizard screen.
</p>
<p>
    "Back" button – navigate back to the previous wizard screen.
</p>
<p>
    Category Association – Add Category associations. Choose a Category Area from
    the dropdown list and click "Add". CADM will update the Term
    Usage to reflect the new association. The "X" icons allow for deletion of specified Category term associations.
</p>
<p>
    Related To: / Related By:
    Terms can be related to each other. Click the "Add" button to the right of Related To:
    on the Edit Term screen. CADM will display a popup grid that is very similar to the Find
    Term screen allowing the user to choose which other terms are related to the current
    term.
    The user may apply filters to narrow the search for related terms. Mark the checkbox next to any term to be related.
    Any terms already related will
    already have a check mark.
    Click the "Return" button to return to the Edit Term screen.
    Relating terms via "Related To:" allows a unique association to another term in the
    database without using anchors embedded in the text of a term definition.
    CADM displays a list of terms that relate to the term being edited in the "Related by:"
    area. Hyperlinks allow the user to navigate to the terms that relate to and are related
    by.

    will prompt for "Term Superseded by TermID: ____." Terms are never deleted from the
    database to avoid broken links.</p>
